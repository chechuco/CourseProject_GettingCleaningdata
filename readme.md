** Summary
This dataset summarize the data obtained by Samsung in an experiment with 30 volunteers
 within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, 
 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone 
 (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they
  captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

** Data processing
The original data was split in train and test data. To perform the analysis, both data sets was merge.
The Samsung teem was 
The final goal is getting the media and standard deviation from several features.

** Raw data
This script assume the original data has been downloaded and the UCI HAR Dataset folder 
is in the working directory". Anyway, data can be retrieved with this script:
if(!file.exists("./Wearable")) {dir.create("Wearable")}
setwd("./Wearable")
fileUrl = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = "filename.zip", method = "curl")
unzip("filename.zip")

** Reading data
As stated in https://class.coursera.org/getdata-031/forum/thread?thread_id=28, 
the data can be read into R with:

data <- read.table(file_path, header = TRUE)

Â· The dataset includes the following files:

- run_analysis.R: the script to perform the analysis.
- codebook.md:	describes the dataset.
- readme.md: this file.
